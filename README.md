## Local Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create `.env` and set at least:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/boilabin"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="generate-a-strong-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 3. Set up database

```bash
npx prisma db push
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Start development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Demo Access

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `admin@boilabin.com` | `Admin@123` |
| Customer | `customer@example.com` | `Customer@123` |

### Useful routes

- Storefront: `http://localhost:3000`
- Admin: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
- Seller: `http://localhost:3000/seller`

---

## NPM Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Start Next.js in development
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Run production server
npm run lint       # Lint project
npm run db:seed    # Seed demo data
npm run db:studio  # Open Prisma Studio
npm run db:reset   # Reset and reseed database
```

---

## Payments

### Currently working

- `Cash on Delivery`

### Present in UI, but not live until gateway integration is completed

- `bKash`
- `Nagad`
- `Card / Online Banking`
- `Stripe`

This keeps the checkout honest: unsupported gateways should not pretend to complete payment until a real gateway handoff exists.

---

## Admin Coverage

The admin panel is designed to manage the store as a real working operations dashboard.

### Included sections

- Products
- Categories
- Brands
- Orders
- Reviews
- Coupons
- Inventory
- Flash sales
- Banners
- Content blocks
- Reports
- Settings
- Seller review and control flows

---

## Marketplace Direction

Boilabin is built so it can stay first-party now and still grow into a broader marketplace later.

### Current direction

- Single-store friendly storefront
- Seller model and seller dashboard foundation already present
- Admin can review seller-side flows and marketplace-style entities

### Future-ready path

- Enable third-party seller onboarding fully
- Add live seller payouts and payment settlements
- Expand seller compliance and approval workflows

---

## SEO Notes

The project already supports product-focused metadata patterns such as:

- `iPad Pro price in BD`
- `iPad Pro price in Bangladesh`
- Brand-aware meta descriptions with BDT pricing
- Product metadata generation from product fields

This makes product pages more suitable for search-driven ecommerce traffic in Bangladesh.

---

## Asset Organization

All long-term static assets are grouped for easier maintenance.

```text
public/assets/
|-- branding/
|-- categories/
`-- payments/
```

This keeps permanent visuals separate from uploaded runtime media under `public/uploads/`.

---

## Why This Project Stands Out

- Bangladesh-focused ecommerce flow instead of a generic template-only build
- Real admin structure, not just a storefront demo
- Seller-ready architecture without forcing marketplace complexity too early
- Strong asset organization and SEO-aware content direction
- Designed to be polished visually while still practical to extend

---

## Development Notes

### Product comparison

The compare page now supports:

- side-by-side pricing
- stock status
- ratings
- category info
- product description
- direct add-to-cart actions

### Flash deals

Flash deal banners and sections now only appear when there is a real active flash-sale campaign with actual products behind it.

---

## Roadmap

- Live Bangladesh payment gateway integration
- Production-grade caching and rate limiting
- More advanced seller operations
- Better reporting and export flows
- Stronger visual product media and showcase polish

---

## License

This project is currently private and maintained as a custom product build.
